# tweepy
this app uses tweepy(twitter api) to extract the first 20 twitter trends for a country.

NOTE you would have to create a twitter developer account in order to acquire  consumer keys, consumer secrets, acess token and access tokens.

Search for the WHERE ON EARTH ID number for the country u want extract the trends for and replace it in the code where we have WOEID.


ANY CONTRIBUTION IS HIGHLY WELLCOME.
